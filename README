== CFup file upload progress indicator

CFup is a file upload progress indicator written
in ColdFusion and javascript. It makes use of other
projects such as Scriptaculous, Prototype, and a
modified version Fancy Upload. 

After it being idle so long, I've decided to open
source it. That forced me to finally clean up
[some] of the code, and I'm excited to see
contributions to further it's development.
